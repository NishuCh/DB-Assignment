### 1. Explain the relationship between the "Product" and "Product_Category" entities from the above diagram. ###

### Ans: The diagram you've provided appears to be an entity-relationship diagram (ERD) for a database schema related to an e-commerce platform. The "Product" and "Product_Category" entities have a relationship that is typically one-to-many, which is indicated by the line connecting them with a "1" near the "Product_Category" entity and a crow's foot (representing many) near the "Product" entity.In this context, the "Product_Category" entity represents different categories that products can belong to. Each category has attributes like an ID, name, description, and timestamps for creation, modification, and deletion.The "Product" entity represents individual products and has attributes such as an ID, name, description, SKU (Stock Keeping Unit), category ID (which is a foreign key referencing the "Product_Category" entity), inventory ID, price, discount ID, and timestamps for creation, modification, and deletion.The relationship between these two entities means that each product belongs to exactly one category, while each category can have multiple products associated with it. The "category_id" field in the "Product" entity is the foreign key that links a product to its respective category in the "Product_Category" entity. This setup allows for the organization of products into distinct categories for better management and retrieval.

### 2. How could you ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it? ###


### Ans:To ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it, you can enforce referential integrity through the use of foreign key constraints in the database schema. When creating the database tables for "Product" and "Product_Category", you would define the relationship between them by setting up a foreign key constraint on the "category_id" column in the "Product" table. This foreign key constraint would reference the primary key column (usually the "ID" column) in the "Product_Category" table.By setting up this foreign key constraint, the database management system will ensure that any value entered into the "category_id" column of the "Product" table must already exist in the primary key column of the "Product_Category" table. This means that you cannot insert a product with a category ID that does not correspond to a valid category in the "Product_Category" table.
